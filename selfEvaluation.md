# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
 *Average.*
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*I had to apply more than before attention and hours of practice and active search.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*Will practice during mornings more. Pairing has been the best exercise to get a feedback.*
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*Will do search myself first. Sometimes sharing the questions do resolve it way faster.*
